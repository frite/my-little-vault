Various scripts in various languages that I developed from time to time. If you find them useful, you can always use them. If you find them crappy, you can always help.

**UPDATE**

Read this **CAREFULLY**. Most sources in here are not meant to be used in __stable__ environments. They are __not secure__. Actually they were not designed to be secure in the first place. They were designed to speed up university projects.

Also, as of now, this repo holds whatever random scripts don't fit
anywhere else and they are not big enough to have their own repo.
