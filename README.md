Various scripts in various languages that I developed from time to time. If you find them useful, you can always use them. If you find them crappy, you can always help. 

**UPDATE**

Read this **CAREFULLY**. Most sources in here are not meant to be used in __stable__ environments. They are __not secure__. Actually they were not designed to be secure in the first place. They were designed to speed up university projects.

**PHP Scripts** 

Functions mostly and a MySQL Class I wrote which is pretty rubbish.

**Python Scripts** 

Functions mostly and a MySQL Class I wrote which is pretty rubbish.

**C/C++ sources**

Eeerm, go on your own and check them
